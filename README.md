# BBMapDocumentation
A map custom map documentation for the Roblox game: Bad Business. This document will compare and contrast the differences between normal exports and uneditable exports, and showing how to edit an export to make it editable/uneditable.

# Differences
As the official plugin for the studio states 
"export: exports the map, can be loaded in game or in studio
export uneditable: exports the map, can be loaded in game but not in studio"
This is true, but comparing the two files in this rep, "editable", and "uneditable" (both correspond with the respective type), you can notics that the text of string itself is same.
The only key difference is the prefix (Y1UAT is used for editable files, while Y0MAT is used for uneditable files.)

# Why does this matter?
Being able to freely make an uneditable file editable, can allow you to openly edit anyone's map. This can lead to content theft, but more importantly, allows you to edit and view the official maps of Bad Business. Being able to do this can help map creators understand how the core maps function, and see how the good maps are good. This can help expand the map making community, and help the pre-existing one understand the maps better.

# How can I get the maps from the game?
Being able to get the maps can help with understanding how the core mechanics of the game work, although it is not to the public to my knowledge.
It will also allow you to use official assets, letting creators like myself integrate the map more into the game.
The core maps of Bad Business are stored in the ReplicatedStorage of the official game files, and can be extracted with third party tools such as SynapseX, or DarkDex (Do be aware that using external tools can be detected by the anti-cheat, and will get you banned.)

I am currently attempting to extract the maps, but it might take time. If you need to contact me dm me on Discord (seraphattack)
